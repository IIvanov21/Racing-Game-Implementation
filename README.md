# Racing-Game-Implementation
Implementation of a racing game with basic functionality which involves collision/resolution, race stages, timer,  
Artificial Intelligence implementation as NPC and player control car. 
This project was created with custom engine created by lecturers and following Game Design Documentation. 
The point of the project is to be able to build a simple racing gaming using classes as multiple files, 
demonstrating different algorithms working together.
The controls for the game are:
W-Accelerate/Forwards,
S-Deccelerate/Backwards,
A-Turn Left,
D-Turn Right,
1-Resets camera orientation to 3rd person,
2-Sets camera view to 1st person,
Mouse-Rotate camera,
Space-Start button and Boost button,
User Interface displays:
Count down on start,
Speed Boost-Boost count in seconds to simulate overheating & warning displayed 1 second before overheating,
Health- Simulates health when you crash with certain speed into objects,
Speed display: With set limits for forwards and backwards.
Things I want to further implements and develop:
AI implementation- I am currently learning about different path finding methods such as Breadth-first search and have the NPC find its own 
path rather than follow one with a set checkpoints.
Create a level editor as a library which can create models and assign collision to them usign filestream,
so it allows to me further expand the game rapidly.
